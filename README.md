# Effortless CI Integration: Running Playwright Tests with GitHub Actions




In the field of continuous integration (CI), we aim to strengthen our code base by ensuring that every change we make undergoes rigorous testing before it goes into production. Embracing CI means automating test execution with each commit and pull request, working against potential bugs or regressions. To integrate our test pipeline with CI, whether you use Jenkins, Travis CI, GitHub Actions or any other service provider, the process remains consistent: automate the execution of tests after code changes, and this builds confidence in the stability of our applications .
Among the multitude of CI service providers, GitHub stands out as a favorite, thanks to its popularity. With Playwright's native support for GitHub Actions, the setup process is streamlined to perfection. Simply push your code to a GitHub repository and witness GitHub in action effortlessly running your tests in a CI environment.
